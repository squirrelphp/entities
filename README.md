Squirrel Entities Component
===========================

Simple, safe and flexible implementation of handling SQL entities and repositories as well as multi-table SQL queries while staying lightweight and easy to understand and use.

This package is still not 100% finished - some tests are missing (although the most important parts have test coverage) and the documentation will be a challenge. For now it is released so it can be used as-is and improved over time.
