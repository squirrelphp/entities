Simple & safe implementation of handling SQL entities and repositories as well as multi-table SQL queries while staying lightweight and easy to understand and use. Offers rapid application development by generating repositories (which should not be added to VCS) for entities, and [squirrelphp/entities-bundle](https://github.com/squirrelphp/entities-bundle) offers automatic integration of these repositories into Symfony.

This package is still not 100% finished - mainly documentation is lacking and needs to be added, and some slight API changes are still possible, although unlikely at this point. Some refactoring would also be good.
